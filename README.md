SwordCraftOnline Resource Pack

# Deployment
Any changes made to master trigger a pipeline to build the resource pack and push it to our webserver. The progress of builds can be tracked [here](https://github.com/peacefulcraft-network/SwordCraftOnline-Resource-Pack/actions) and the files will be uploaded [here](https://cdn.peacefulcraft.net/resources/) upon completion.

The server will not tell clients that there is a new version of the resource pack available until the `resource-pack-sha1` property in `server.properties` is changed. This value is also generated in the build process and is placed in the `hash.sha1` file with the resource pack at the above link. Just open the `.sha1` file, copy the hash out, and paste the new value into server config and restart. Note that the hash is just the first string, do not include the filename. IE: `ece3b3e0f4e12d98cba2ad6e0be19237293838b3`.

**Step By Step**
1. Merge / push changes to master
2. Wait for pipeline to [complete](https://github.com/peacefulcraft-network/SwordCraftOnline-Resource-Pack/actions)
3. The resource pack .zip file will be [here](https://cdn.peacefulcraft.net/resources/swordcraftonline_resource_pack.zip)
4. The sha1 hash will be [here](https://cdn.peacefulcraft.net/resources/hash.sha1)
5. To update the resource pack on a server, get the hash from the hash file linked in step 4 and paste it into the `resource-pack-sha1` field of the `server.properties` file. Example: `resource-pack-sha1=ece3b3e0f4e12d98cba2ad6e0be19237293838b3`.
6. Restart server

**Versio Note**
Note that the hash value only tells the client when to download a new version of the resource pack. If someone downloads the resource pack, it updates, and the hash does not get updated in `server.properties`, then that user will not see the updated resource pack. However, if a user who has not already downloads the resource pack joins the server, they will download the new resource pack because it is the only copy available. This is not inherently bad, but is important to know if you start seeing weird assets and models and other people dont.
